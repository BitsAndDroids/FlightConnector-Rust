# Logs

When tinkering with your projects, seeing what the connector does can provide valuable information.

## Log window

You can use the log window to see a live stream of the logs being output.
The log window can be accessed from the main menu.
It shows the last 1000 log entries.
The logs can fill up quite rapidly if you send a lot of data to or from your controller.
If you need some breathing room to analyze the logs, you’re able to pause and resume the log stream using the pause button.

## Log file

Looking for information about events that happened when the log window was closed? Don’t worry.
All logs get saved to an external file as well.
This provides a more accessible format to share during a bug report as well.
On Windows, you can type %localappdata% in the file explorer address bar to navigate to your appdata/local folder.
The log files can be found in the bitsanddroids/logs folder.
